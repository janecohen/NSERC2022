Our galaxy has been studied for millennia in an attempt to understand what exists beyond planet earth. More specifically, the earliest records show a fascination with the stars that light up the dark sky. And the fixation on these celestial bodies has not faded. As technology improves, our ability to describe the formation and evolution of stars continues to progress. Despite the rapid advances in this field of study, many details regarding the environments in which stars form are still unknown.

Where do we come in?

I’m Jane Cohen, a student from Queen’s University studying Engineering Physics and Applied Computing. During the summer of 2022 I had the pleasure of working with Professor R. Plume. Together, we developed the early steps of a procedure that allows us to easily process data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to help us better understand the environments of star formation. My side of the project was heavily based on developing the procedure and maximizing the efficiency of the software being used. This repository contains the majority of the codes I wrote during the four months.
